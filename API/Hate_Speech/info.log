API called for string: Hi guys ! I'm so shocked when my facebook was disabled with no reason ! I'm so depressed because my family in abroad can't contact me and I'm sure they're so worried :'( I already filed an appeal to fb and send an email to disabled@facebook.com and still waiting for their response. Anyone here with the same issue like me ? Did you recover your account ? How long does it takes ? Anyone please help me im gonna die i miss my loved ones so much :'( - offended facebook user. We can't all be wrong at all times!! facebook takes an action for fake reports without really investigating!! Very pathetic..
